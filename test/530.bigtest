x resolution example 2 from our paper
replica a b c d
create a/foo 'abcd'
sync a b
sync a c
sync a d
change b/foo 'ab'
sync b a
change c/foo 'cd'
sync c d
change a/foo 'a'
# change d/foo 'd' # d does not change the file in this example.
sync -C b c
# suppose we resolve by choosing b's copy
sync -f b c foo
sync c b
# then there should be no conflict at ab
sync a b
sync b a
# nor at cd
sync c d
sync d c
isfile a/foo 'a'
isfile b/foo 'a'
isfile c/foo 'ab'
isfile d/foo 'ab'
# moving along, if c syncs with a, it should take a's copy
sync a c
isfile c/foo 'a'
