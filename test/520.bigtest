x resolution example 1 from our paper, case 3
replica a b c d
create a/foo 'abcd'
sync a b
sync a c
sync a d
change b/foo 'ab'
sync b a
change c/foo 'cd'
sync c d
change a/foo 'a'
change d/foo 'd'
sync -C b c
# suppose we resolve by making a new file
sync -b b c foo
change c/foo 'bc'
sync c b
# then there should be a conflict at ab
sync -C a b
# resolve for b
sync -b a b foo
sync b a
# and a conflict at cd
sync -C c d
sync -C d c
isfile a/foo 'bc'
isfile d/foo 'd'
